# mutVis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mutVis is to compare the sequence of an unknown or mutated protein with a set of known protein sequences, find the best matched ones, and plot the amino acid differences on a graph.

## Installation

You can install the released version of mutVis from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` {r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("angelawong1526/mutVis", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("mutVis")
```
To run the shinyApp:
```{r eval=FALSE}
runMutVisApp()
```

## Overview

```{r eval=FALSE}
browseVignettes("mutVis")
ls("package:mutVis")
```

This package contains 6 functions to analyze and compare the input protein sequence with known protein sequences and to find the best matches with the input protein. The results are visualized on a scatter plot. There is one function available for the users:

`matchProt()`: The main plotting function. This function generates a scatter plot with all the amino acid differences found in known protein sequences. The amino acids are represented on the x-axis in numerical form; they follow the order of "A, G, I, L, P, V, F, W, Y, D, E, R, H, K, S, T, C, M, N, Q", represented by number 1 through 20 (1 being "A" and 20 being "Q").
```{r eval=FALSE}
unknownProt <- "MAVLILVLLAVVILQAAPIRKLEDLLPTRYPPDHELVYWCTYANQCDFCWECVHGICRNRIQADWPVIHQNDWIINCTVSRWNGICSYYEGPRNHTDHQMDCANPTSHTYPHREYMKIYERDDL"
minPercent <- 95
result <- matchProt(unknownProt, minMatch = minPercent)
result
```
